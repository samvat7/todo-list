This Node.js project is a simple task manager application. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The application is built using the Express.js framework and EJS templating engine for the views. Users can mark tasks as completed, delete individual tasks or all checked tasks, and view the list of tasks.
